JavaScript and HTML DOM (to display or use the data).
how ajax works:
1. An event occurs in a web page (the page is loaded, a button is clicked)
2. An XMLHttpRequest object is created by JavaScript
3. The XMLHttpRequest object sends a request to a web server
4. The server processes the request
5. The server sends a response back to the web page
6. The response is read by JavaScript
7. Proper action (like page update) is performed by JavaScript
25)what is JSON?
 a)JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation
 JSON is a lightweight format for storing and transporting data
 JSON is often used when data is sent from a server to a web page(first when a action is done on the webpage that xmlhttp request is send to server from then  server send information to database so by using Json the database send data to the server and by using Json server send data to webpage and then js will convert JSON to js to see the response. )
 JSON is "self-describing" and easy to understand
26)what is bootstrap?
 a)Bootstrap is the most popular CSS Framework for developing responsive and mobile-first websites.
   Bootstrap 5 is the newest version of Bootstrap.
27)what is github?
 a)GitHub is a code hosting platform for collaboration and version control(Version control, also known as source control, is the practice of tracking and managing changes to software code. ).
  GitHub lets you (and others) work together on projects.
  GitHub essentials are:
      Repositories
      Branches

 a)library has few rules.                              framework has more rules.
   when we call the code it is library                 in this case framework calls the code.
32) what is API?
 a)API is  Application Programming Interface, which is a software intermediary that allows two applications to talk to each other. for example: if you want to book airindia flight ticket no need to book in airindia website we ca also book in makemytrip so when we book the airindia flight ticket in the makemytrip app we get the flight ticket. in this case the makemytrip uses Airindia API by using that API both the websites can communicate.
